# [RepoDb.Oracle](https://repodb.net/tutorial/get-started-Oracle) - a hybrid .NET ORM library for Oracle.

RepoDB is an open-source .NET ORM library that bridges the gaps of micro-ORMs and full-ORMs. It helps you simplify the switch-over of when to use the BASIC and ADVANCE operations during the development.
